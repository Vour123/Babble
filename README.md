# Welcome to Babble

Babble is a real time chat application that has multiple C.R.U.D features. Users are able to create servers and create channels within those servers. Within those channels users are allowed to communicate with others inside of the channel as well. All messagings are updated live using web sockets. Babble is a really rough clone of slack.

## Feature plans for Babble
Some features I would like to add to Babble:
 * the ablility to be able to video chat one-on-one with anyone who you have a direct message with. 
 * let the owner/admins kick out users
 * add a members list for people who exist in the server so you can start a direct message with them.
